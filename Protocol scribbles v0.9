#SCRIBBLES
I noticed that ALL commands are between brackets [  ] 
Not all commands are embedded in all ATM models.. It sometimes gives a 'bad response'

Superhandy tip is to not send line feeds in your terminal program. That will mess up the commands.
If the FT232 USB device for reading Serial signals is not regognized on your PC, please visit this address for drivers:

The notes are scribbles in no particular order.
We dug up the cable and found a serial line..
We tapped it and cross checked with the documentation we 'obtained'..


[ListPrivateBankNr]
Seems to work in residential areas where the high value private banking customers live.
Sort of High Avalability option to cache this locally in the ATM, we can only assume that the ATM queries this list once in a while.


[Deposit:accountnr:money]
So funny, you can actually make any deposit to any account, so cool. No integrity check seems to be in place.
The ATM must be able to do so but I wonder if that can be faked or it is in a config database.. research needed.

[RebootKeyLost:ATM123:X]
To break the crypto would be very time consuming. It uses post quantum crypto, HMAC and ephemeral ECC with SECP512 quadratation (uh huh)..
I read about another way in the ATM manual that was'found' during our team research' at the ATM factory. 
It is actualy a downgrade attack based on the possible event where the private key of the ATM would be lost. 
ATM123 is to be replaced by ATM + number (so 123 would be the number as noted on the ATM)
Then the X is the Modulo 7 of the number. In the case of 123 it would be 4. 
Not really secure but perhaps invented for service engineers in the field without random generator.
Without this, the plain text inserts will not work.


[Dispense:accountnr:money]
This one is so cool!! I actually got it to give money.
There seems to be a limit up until 250,-. 
Any Higher amount requires a SHA1 calculation over the fields in this exact form "bankaccount:amount" without the quotes.
SHA1 calculator e.g. at http://www.sha1-online.com/
Give the command like this [Dispense:accountnr:money][Hash]
Account number must be a valid one. There must be a way to get those..
Money is depicted as 123.50 so a dot '.' and not a comma ','


[SetDepositOn:ATM123:X]
This actually registers the ATM as the kind that also takes customer money and then makes a deposit. 
I wonder If I can spoof messages  here
ATM123 is to be replaced by ATM + number (so 123 would be the number)
Then the X is the Modulo 7 of the number. In the case of 123 it would be 4

[SetDepositOff:ATM123:X]
Why use this one?
